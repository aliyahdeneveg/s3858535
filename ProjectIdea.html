								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The project for a new smartphone app is going to be called "Seefood".This is going to be really useful for people who wants to be healthy and or wants to check what are the ingredients in their food or the nutrition facts about their food or recipe for making any food that they can do at home and give them a healthier version of what they eat. Further details about this app is under the description. In here we are also talking about my motivation on why I am making this mobile phone app. The skills that is needed for making this app and tools and technology that will be used be in order for this app to come to life.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>What motivated me to make this app is that people tend to be not aware of what is in their food and if it is healthy or not. Tabloids or advertisement can be misleading and individuals might think that what they are eating are healthy but it is not.</p>
								<p>In Australia, the obesity rate is 36.3% and Victoria it self ranged from 17%</p>
								<p> In 2016 according to WHO there was 1.9 billion adults that was 18 years and older were overweight and 650 million of these were obese. People tend to not be aware of what they are eating and just eat with risking their health. </p>
								<p> This numbers are concerning, making this app will help people understand healthy food and seek for more healthy foods in the palm of their hands</p>
								<p>Hence why, making this app will help lessen obesity in the world or maybe just Victoria or Australia itself.</p>

								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>What is the new mobile phone about?</p>
								<p> This new mobile phone app is about a person ability to use his or her phone to check dietary, ingredients and nutrition facts of what they are eating. This will help individuals being more aware of what they are eating and what is really on their food. The feature on the app is that it can access to your mobile phone camera and just simply take a picture or place your phone above the food and it will show the user ingredients, nutritional facts and dietary information about the food that you are eating. Another feature of this app is that users can access healthier recipes for their foods and show them ingredients that they need. With the help of nutritionist and dietetics as well as working with both IOS and Android to make sure that this app will have all the nutrition facts and diet requirements. Work and research to find healthier option food for the user instead of the user searching around for healthier option. </p>

								<h3>Tools and Technologies </h3>
								<p>In order to make this app must have the knowledge of programming languages  for an Apple IOS developer using Objective- C and for Android typically use Java for creating this app. Using an app inventor called MIT app inventor. So typically, the tools and technologies needed for making an IOS app will be IOS SDK, Objective-C and swift. For the Android app the technologies and tools needed is JAVA for android, Android SDK  and Kotlin. For the database solutions using a MySQL. As far as doing more research found that XCode is one native mobile development tool that can be used to make an IOS app and Android Studio is an Android development software built by the google.</p>

								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
								<p>The skills required for making this app is having a product management, this role is an important as it’s a major between the project team and the client. Having User Centred Design skills as well is needed to make sure the user experience is met up to the highest expectations. Programming Skills and having experience for Java, IOS SDK, Objective-C a C ++ programming all this skill is needed in order for the app to come alive. As mobile phone is the technology of the future, we want an app developer that will select the suitable coding languages in HTML5, JAVA, C++, C# , objective-c and swift. </p>

								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>If the project is successful, the outcome will be that people will use it and hopefully people are more aware of what they are eating and the obesity rate in the world goes down. The impact of this new development is that more and more people use it and therefore more and more people are aware of what they are eating. Having this app will help individuals be more aware of what they are putting inside their body and individuals will eat more healthy option food when they realise what they eat are not healthy and aren’t good for their body and for their health and wellbeing. </p>
