								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The project for a new smartphone app called "DAILY" is designed for students whom are in High School or University. This app will allow to have their daily schedules and or task on the palm of their hands. Came around on this idea as this day and age students are likely to be in their smartphone 24/7 and tend to forget about their assessments or any task for their school/university.</p>
								<p>There are thousands and thousands of app just like this but what will make it different is the fact that students doesn't have to enter their schedules but this "Daily" app can connect to their school or univeristy system i.e. like Canvas or Google Classroom.</p>
