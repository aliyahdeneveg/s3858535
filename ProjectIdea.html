								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The project for a new smartphone app is gonna be called "Seefood".This is gonna be really useful for people who wants to be healthy and or wants to check what are the ingredients in their food or the nutrition facts about their food or receipe for making any food that they can do at home and give them a healthier version of what they eat. Further details about this app is under the description. In here we are also talking about my motivation on why I am making this mobile phone app. The skills that is needed for making this app and tools and techonolgy that will be used be in order for this app to come to life.</p>

								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>What motivated me to make this app is that people tend to be not aware of what is in their food and if it is healthy or not. Tabloids or advertisement can be misleading and individuals might think that what they are eating are healthy but it is not.</p>
								<p>In Australia, the obesity rate is 36.3% and Victoria it self ranged from 17%</p>
								<p> In 2016 according to WHO there was 1.9 billion adults that was 18 years and older were overweight and 650 million of these were obese. People tend to not be aware of what they are eating and just eat with risking their health. </p>
								<p> This numbers are concerning, making this app will help people understand healthy food and seek for more healthy foods in the palm of their hands</p>
								<p>Hence why, making this app will help lessen obesity in the world or maybe just Victoria or Australia itself.</p>
