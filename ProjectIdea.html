								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The project for a new smartphone app called "DAILY" is designed for students whom are in High School or University. This app will allow to have their daily schedules and or task on the palm of their hands. Came around on this idea as this day and age students are likely to be in their smartphone 24/7 and tend to forget about their assessments or any task for their school/university.</p>
								<p>There are thousands and thousands of app just like this but what will make it different is the fact that students doesn't have to enter their schedules but this "Daily" app can connect to their school or univeristy system i.e. like Canvas or Google Classroom.</p>
							</section>

								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>What motivated me to do this projet is for the fact that me personally do tend to forget some schedules when I was back in High School and as well as during the first semester on being a univeristy student. This IT project motivates me as it will not only benefit me but will also benefit other students as well.</p>
								<p> During hard times students tend to forget their class schedules or assessment that is due so by creating this app that reminds them constantly about their assessments or test two weeks before hand. </p>
