								<p>The big five assessment measures yoour scores on five major dimensions of the personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism</p>	
								<p> With the Big Five Test Openness is 96%, Conscientiousness 83% , Extraversion 62.5%, Agreeableness 92% and Neuroticism 69% </p>
								<p> The meaning of the result states that my openness and agreeableness is the highest amogst the five dimensions Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.</p>
								<p> This means that openness is strongly related to a persons' interest in art and culture. People who are high in the openness tend to enjoy the arts and seek out unusual, complex forms of self-expression. As well as high scorers tend to be creative, adventurous and intellectual.</p>

								<h3>REFLECTION ON THE THREE TEST</h3>
								<p>This first and last test really shows that I am a open person who likes to hear out people and be there for people and how I have control in order to pursue my goals. As well according to the Myers-Briggs Test it shows that I am the counselor this means that drive to help others with their potential. With the learning test I am an auditory learner this means I learn thru hearing and listening and I remember things that I have heard and store information by the way it sounds and have easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. These result influence how I behave in a team as I learn better with hearing and listening to my team about their concern or if they are ever in need of help I am able to help them due to me being helping others with their potential. Taking this test into an account when forming a team as it's really important to have all the team to be working and in task together and how it's really important for me for my learning as well to really listen to my team or my manager or the leader to make my learning better and understand the project better. Being an idealist organiser shows that the team must be organised and in time with the project with no delays. This will impact on forming a team as the team as well must be organised. </p>
